- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sammy1859
- ðŸ‘€ 2022 Honda Ridgeline bug #23487. There is a bit of noise in the brake pedal it seems raising the threshold to .1 fixes the problem. Has the build been modified with this
new correction. So far up 2021 is compatiable.  I am buying a new comma 3 soon and need to know how if i have to incorperate this new change.
